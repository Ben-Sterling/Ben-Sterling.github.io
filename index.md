Hi! I'm a predoctoral researcher at UT Austin’s [Center for Media Engagement](https://mediaengagement.org/), where I investigate how personal stories circulate through large-scale social data, shaping cross-partisan engagement and cross-cultural norms.

I graduated from Yale with a major in Cognitive Science in 2025, where I studied computational models of social reasoning and theory of mind with [Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/).

Broadly, I’m interested in how minds and groups construct **generative stories**: how narrative structure guides inference and memory for individuals, and how communicative feedback turns those stories into shared norms.
