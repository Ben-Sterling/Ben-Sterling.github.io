I'm currently a predoctoral researcher at UT Austin’s [Center for Media Engagement](https://mediaengagement.org/) where I study how personal stories travel through large-scale social data and shape cross-partisan engagement and emerging group norms.

Broadly, I’m interested in how minds and groups construct **generative stories**: how narrative structure guides inference and memory for individuals, and how communicative feedback turns those stories into shared norms. Before UT, I worked in computational social cognition at Yale, using Bayesian/RSA-style models of theory of mind and pragmatic communication; my undergraduate thesis modeled deception as audience-design—how people tailor lies to what listeners want to believe.

**Current threads**
- Narrative dynamics in online publics (Reddit-scale data; causal/norm formation)
- Pragmatics, explanation, and teaching as story-shaped inference
- Deception and wishful thinking as strategic audience design

I work across computational modeling, large-scale text pipelines, and collaborative, open science. I care about explanations that are both **mechanistic** and **useful**, the kind that make social life a little easier to understand together.
